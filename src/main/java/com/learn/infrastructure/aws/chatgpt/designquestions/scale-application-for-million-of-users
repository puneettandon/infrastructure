How do you scale an application that serves millions of users?

    Key Considerations:
        Traffic Scaling
        Database Scaling
        Compute Scaling

    AWS Architecture Components:
        1. Compute Scaling:
            Use Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) with EC2.
            Use EKS or ECS with Fargate for containerized apps.
            Use Lambda for event-driven tasks.

        2. Database Scaling:
            RDS Read Replicas for high read traffic.
            Aurora Auto Scaling to handle database load.
            DynamoDB with on-demand scaling for NoSQL.

        3. Traffic Optimization:
            CloudFront CDN to cache static assets.
            ElastiCache (Redis) to reduce database queries.
            API Gateway + Lambda for microservices API.

        4. Security & Resilience:
            WAF & Shield for DDoS protection.
            Multi-AZ Deployments to prevent failure.

    Final Architecture:
        Frontend: S3 + CloudFront
        Compute: ECS/EKS + Auto Scaling
        Database: RDS (Read Replicas) + ElastiCache
        Security: WAF, Shield, IAM
        Scaling: Auto Scaling, Aurora Scaling
