you absolutely can use SonarQube and JIRA with CodeBuild — but it requires custom scripting, not plug-and-play like Jenkins plugins.


Can CodeBuild integrate with:
    | Tool          | Support | How                            |
    | ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ |
    | **SonarQube** | ✅ Yes   | Using CLI and environment vars |
    | **JIRA**      | ✅ Yes   | Using REST API or curl scripts |


Why It's Not Like Jenkins
    - Jenkins has plugins (e.g., SonarQube Plugin, JIRA Plugin)
    - CodeBuild doesn't have plugins — you script everything manually in buildspec.yml


SonarQube with CodeBuild
    What You Need
        - A SonarQube server (self-hosted or SonarCloud)
        - A token for authentication
        - Sonar Scanner CLI in your build container

    Sample buildspec.yml Snippet
        version: 0.2

        phases:
          install:
            commands:
              - echo Installing Sonar Scanner...
              - wget https://binaries.sonarsource.com/Distribution/sonar-scanner-cli/sonar-scanner-cli-4.8.0.2856-linux.zip
              - unzip sonar-scanner-cli-*.zip
              - export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/sonar-scanner-*/bin
          build:
            commands:
              - echo "Running sonar scan..."
              - sonar-scanner \
                  -Dsonar.projectKey=myproject \
                  -Dsonar.sources=. \
                  -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonar.mycompany.com \
                  -Dsonar.login=$SONAR_TOKEN


        You pass SONAR_TOKEN using CodeBuild environment variables (secured).



JIRA with CodeBuild
    What You Can Do
        - Create a ticket from a failed build
        - Add comments to a ticket
        - Transition workflow states

    How to Do It
        - Use curl + JIRA REST API
        - Use build metadata (e.g., git commit message) to link issues


    Sample Command in post_build
        curl -u $JIRA_USER:$JIRA_TOKEN \
          -X POST \
          --data '{"body":"Build succeeded for commit abc123"}' \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          https://jira.mycompany.com/rest/api/2/issue/PROJ-123/comment



Summary
    | Tool            | Jenkins                   | CodeBuild                   |
    | --------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | SonarQube       | Native plugin + dashboard | CLI-based + `buildspec.yml` |
    | JIRA            | Plugin + auto-linking     | REST API scripting          |
    | Flexibility     | GUI-driven                | Script-driven               |
    | Maintainability | Easier for non-devs       | Devs need to write scripts  |



Recommendation
    - For tight plugin integrations and UIs, Jenkins is smoother.
    - For AWS-native CI with control and simplicity, CodeBuild is still powerful — just script more.
