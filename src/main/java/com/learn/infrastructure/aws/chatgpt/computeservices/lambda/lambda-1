AWS Lambda – Complete Guide

1.What is AWS Lambda?
    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales and bills you only for execution time.
    Key Features:
        - Event-driven execution (Triggers from S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, etc.)
        - Automatic scaling (No need to configure servers)
        - Pay-per-use billing (Billed for execution time, not idle time)
        - Supports multiple languages (Python, Java, Node.js, Go, .NET, Ruby)


Core Concepts of AWS Lambda
    a) Function, Event, and Context
        - Function: The code you write to execute.
        - Event: The trigger that invokes the Lambda function.
        - Context: Provides metadata about the invocation, execution time, and request details.
        Example:
            A Lambda function that resizes images when uploaded to an S3 bucket.

    b) Triggers & Event Sources
    Lambda functions can be triggered by various AWS services:
        - S3 → Process uploaded files
        - DynamoDB → React to database changes
        - API Gateway → Build serverless APIs
        - CloudWatch Events → Schedule periodic jobs
        - SQS & SNS → Handle messages asynchronously
        Example Use Case:
            - When a file is uploaded to S3, Lambda resizes it and stores a thumbnail in another bucket.
            - When a DynamoDB table changes, Lambda processes the update and logs it.

    c) Lambda Execution Environment
        - Runs in an AWS-managed container.
        - Provides up to 15 minutes of execution time.
        - Supports environment variables and IAM roles.

    d) Memory & Compute Configuration
        - Memory: 128MB to 10GB (affects CPU power)
        - Execution timeout: 1ms to 15 minutes
        - Ephemeral disk storage (/tmp): 512MB to 10GB (for temporary files)
        - Concurrency: Default limit is 1000 per region (can be increased)

    e) Lambda Deployment Package
    Lambda code can be deployed as:
        - ZIP file (For Python, Java, Node.js, etc.)
        - Container Image (For large applications, supports up to 10GB)
        - Inline Code (For simple functions in Python, JavaScript)


AWS Lambda Pricing Model
    AWS Lambda pricing is based on:
        - Number of requests (First 1 million requests are free, then $0.20 per 1M requests)
        - Execution time (Billed in milliseconds based on memory allocated)
        - Network Transfer Costs (Free within AWS, but data transfer out is charged)
        Cost Optimization Tips
            - Use Provisioned Concurrency for consistent performance.
            - Set Memory & Timeout limits based on real needs.
            - Combine multiple small Lambda functions to reduce cold start issues.


Real-World Applications of AWS Lambda
    1. Serverless APIs
        - Use Case: Build a fully serverless API with API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB.
        - A product catalog API where Lambda fetches product details from DynamoDB.
    2. Automated File Processing
        - Use Case: Process images, videos, or logs.
        - Example: When a user uploads an image to S3, Lambda automatically resizes and stores it.
    3. Event-Driven Workflows
        - Use Case: Trigger Lambda on database changes.
        - Example: A new entry in DynamoDB triggers Lambda to send an email notification.
    4. Scheduled Tasks (Cron Jobs)
        - Use Case: Automate periodic tasks without an EC2 server.
        - Example: A Lambda function that deletes old S3 files every week (Triggered by CloudWatch Events).
    5. Data Processing & Analytics
        - Use Case: Real-time data processing.
        - Example: Lambda processes logs from Kinesis Data Streams for analytics.


Advanced Lambda Topics
    a) Cold Start & Performance Optimization
        - Cold Start: When Lambda runs after a period of inactivity, it takes extra time to initialize.
    Ways to Reduce Cold Starts: ✔ Use Provisioned Concurrency to keep Lambda warm.
        - Keep Function Small (Fewer dependencies = Faster startup).
        - Use Memory Optimization (More memory = Faster execution).
        - Optimize Package Size (Avoid unnecessary libraries).


    b) Lambda with Step Functions
    AWS Step Functions help orchestrate multiple Lambda executions in a workflow.
    Use Case Example:
        Step 1: Lambda fetches data from an API
        Step 2: Another Lambda processes the data
        Step 3: Final Lambda stores results in DynamoDB

        Best for: Complex workflows with multiple steps.

    c) Lambda Security Best Practices
        - Use IAM Roles to restrict access (Least Privilege Principle).
        - Store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager instead of environment variables.
        - Enable AWS X-Ray for debugging and monitoring.
        - Use VPC Endpoint for secure Lambda-to-S3 connections.
