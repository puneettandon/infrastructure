Yes, you can use SNS as part of a daily data export pipeline to customers, but with a specific purpose:
    - SNS is not used to send the actual data, but to notify systems or users that the data is ready.


Typical Use Case: Daily Data Export with SNS
    Let’s say:
        - You generate customer data reports daily (CSV, JSON, etc.)
        - You store them in S3
        - You want to notify each customer/system that:
            - Data is ready
            - Where to fetch it (S3 link or presigned URL)


    How SNS Fits Into the Flow

            [1] Data Generator Job (Lambda, ECS, Glue, Step Function)
                    ↓
               Generates report (e.g., customer123-report.csv)
                    ↓
               Uploads to S3
                    ↓
            [2] Publishes SNS message:
                 "Report ready for customer123: s3://... or presigned URL"
                    ↓
            [3] SNS Fan-Out:
                ├── Email to customer
                ├── HTTP webhook to external system
                ├── Trigger another Lambda (e.g., for processing)

    Why SNS is Useful Here
        | Benefit                                  | Why It Helps                                   |
        | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
        | 🔔 Notify multiple targets               | Email users + webhook system + internal Lambda |
        | 💬 Message contains metadata             | You can include customer name, date, file URL  |
        | 🔌 Integrates with other AWS services    | Trigger Lambda, SQS queues, external HTTP      |
        | ✅ Decouples data generation and delivery | Each system can act independently              |


Sample SNS Message (JSON)

    {
      "customer": "Customer123",
      "date": "2025-07-17",
      "s3Location": "s3://data-reports/customer123/2025-07-17.csv",
      "presignedUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/...expires-in-15min"
    }



But Don't Use SNS to:
    | ❌ Action                                   | Why Not                                                |
    | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Send large data files                      | SNS is not meant to carry files; use S3 + link sharing |
    | Guarantee delivery/order                   | Use **SQS + DLQ** if you need guaranteed delivery      |
    | Store customer-specific messages long term | SNS doesn't persist messages like a database           |


Summary
    Yes, use SNS to notify customers/systems that the data is ready.
    Combine it with S3 for storage, and optionally SQS or Lambda for downstream automation.
