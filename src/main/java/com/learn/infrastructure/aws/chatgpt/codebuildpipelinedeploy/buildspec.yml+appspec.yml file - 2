A sample buildspec.yml + appspec.yml pair for a real-world Java Spring Boot project being built with Maven and deployed to an EC2 instance using AWS CodeBuild + CodeDeploy.


1. buildspec.yml (Used by CodeBuild)
  This file tells CodeBuild how to build and package your application.

      version: 0.2

      phases:
        install:
          commands:
            - echo Installing Maven...
            - mvn --version
        pre_build:
          commands:
            - echo Logging in to CodeBuild...
        build:
          commands:
            - echo Building the Java application...
            - mvn clean package -DskipTests
        post_build:
          commands:
            - echo Build complete. Preparing artifacts...
            - mkdir -p output
            - cp target/*.jar output/
            - cp appspec.yml output/
            - cp -r scripts/ output/

      artifacts:
        files:
          - output/**/*



  This generates a deployable ZIP containing:
    target/*.jar, appspec.yml, and the scripts/ folder.



2. appspec.yml (Used by CodeDeploy)
    This file defines where to place the artifact and what deployment scripts to run on the EC2 instance.


      version: 0.0
      os: linux

      files:
        - source: /
          destination: /home/ec2-user/myapp

      hooks:
        BeforeInstall:
          - location: scripts/stop_app.sh
            timeout: 60
            runas: ec2-user

        AfterInstall:
          - location: scripts/install_dependencies.sh
            timeout: 60
            runas: ec2-user

        ApplicationStart:
          - location: scripts/start_app.sh
            timeout: 60
            runas: ec2-user



Sample scripts/ folder contents
      
  These are Bash scripts that get executed at different lifecycle stages.
        
        scripts/stop_app.sh
          #!/bin/bash
          pkill -f myapp.jar || echo "App not running"
  
  
        scripts/install_dependencies.sh
          #!/bin/bash
          sudo yum install -y java-17-amazon-corretto || true
  
  
        scripts/start_app.sh
          #!/bin/bash
          cd /home/ec2-user/myapp
          nohup java -jar target/myapp.jar > app.log 2>&1 &
