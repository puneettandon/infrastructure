Common Ways to Automatically Trigger Lambda

    1. Scheduled (Time-Based) â€“ EventBridge / CloudWatch

        For daily/hourly exports.
            Setup:
                Use Amazon EventBridge (previously CloudWatch Events)
                Create a rule with a cron or rate expression
                Target = your Lambda function

        Example: Run every day at 8 AM IST
            cron(30 2 * * ? *)   // UTC time = 8:00 AM IST

        Best for: Daily exports, weekly reports, etc.


    2. API Gateway Trigger
        If you want to trigger export on demand via HTTP request (e.g., from UI or external system).
            - Lambda is invoked via REST API endpoint.
            - You can pass parameters like date, type, format, etc.

    3. S3 Event Trigger
        - Automatically export when a file is uploaded (e.g., trigger export when a config or manifest file is uploaded).
        Example: Upload a JSON config to s3://your-bucket/exports/config.json to start the export.


    4. SQS or SNS Trigger
        - Trigger export when a message comes in (e.g., from a data pipeline).
        Best for:
            Export requests from another system
            Queue-based decoupling
            Retry support with DLQ


    5. EventBridge Event Bus (Custom Event Triggers)
        You can emit custom events to EventBridge and trigger Lambda based on patterns like:

            {
              "source": "myapp.data.export",
              "detailType": "daily-report",
              "detail": {
                "reportType": "summary",
                "date": "2025-07-18"
              }
            }


Combined Example:
    Imagine this setup:
        - An EventBridge rule triggers the Lambda every day at 6 AM.
        - The Lambda:
            - Calls internal APIs.
            - Generates a CSV report.
            - Uploads to S3 (exports/daily-report-2025-07-18.csv).
            - Sends SNS/Slack/Email notification with the download link.


Permissions Required
    Your Lambda's IAM role must have permission to:
        Invoke APIs (e.g., via VPC, Secrets Manager if needed)
        Write to S3 (s3:PutObject)
        Publish to SNS / Send via SES (optional)
