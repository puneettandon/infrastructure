Security Groups

-> It is a virtual firewall works at ENI level
-> Upto 5 security groups per EC2 instance interface can be applied
-> can only have permit rules, cannot have deny rule
-> Stateful, return traffic, of allowed inbound traffic is allowed , even if there are no rules to allow it


Security Groups work on ec2 level

NACL - network address control list work availability zone or region level or vpc level

NACL can have permit as well as deny rule


Network ACL

-> It is a function performed on the implied router
-> NACL is an optional layer of security for your vpc that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out
of one or more subnets
-> Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL.By default , it allows all inbound
and outbound ipv4 and if applicable, ipv6 traffic
-> You can create a custom network ACL and associate it with a subnet.By default , each custom network ACL
denies all inbound and outbound traffic until you add rules.
-> The highest number that you can use for a rule is 32766. Recommend that you start by creating rules with rule numbers
that  a multiple of 100, so that you can insert new rules where you need later
-> It functions at the subnet level
-> NACL are stateless, outbound traffic for an allowed inbound traffic, must be explicitly allowed too
-> You can have permit and deny rules in a NACL
