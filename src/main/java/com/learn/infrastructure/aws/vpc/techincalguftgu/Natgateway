prevent internet from initiating a connection with those instances.
NAT Gateway ----- use only Elastic IP

public subnet - basically host website instance / application instances
private subnet - basically host databases instances

NAT stays in public subnet

-> You are charged for creating and using a NAT gateway in your account.NAT Gateway hourly usage and data processing rates apply
Amazon EC2 charges for data transfer also apply

-> To create a NAT gateway, you must specify the public subnet in which the NAT Gateway should reside
-> You must also specify an Elastic IP address to associate with NAT Gateway when you create it
-> No need to assign public IP address to your private instances in private subnet

-> After you have created a NAT Gateway you must update the route table associated with one or more of your private subnets to point internet.
