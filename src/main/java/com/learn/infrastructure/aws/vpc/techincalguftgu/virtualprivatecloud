Virtual Private Cloud

A virtual private cloud is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional networking that you operate in your
own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

    or


VPC is a virtual network or data network inside AWS for one client.

-> It is logically isolated from other virtual network in the AWS Cloud.

-> Max 5 VPC can be created in one region and 200 subnets in 1 VPC.

-> We can allocate max 5 elastic IP

-> Once we created VPC, DHCP(Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol),NACL(Network Access Control List), and Security Group will be
automatically created

-> A VPC is confined to an AWS Region and does not extend between Regions

-> Once the VPC is created, you cannot change its CIDR Block Range

-> If you need a different CIDR size, create a new vpc

-> The different subnets within a VPC cannot overlap

-> You can however expand your VPC CIDR by adding new/extra IP address ranges(except GovCloud and AWS china)

-> Components of VPC

    CIDR and IP address Subnets
    - Implied router and routing table
    - Internet Gateway
    - Security Groups
    - Network ACL
    - Virtual Private Gateway
    - Peering Connections
    - Elastic IP

VPC Types

Default VPC         Custom VPC

Default VPC
    created in each AWS region when an AWS account is created
    Has default CIDR, security group, NACL and route table settings
    Has an internet gateway by default

Custom VPC
    Is a vpc an AWS account owner creates
    Aws user creating the custom vpc can decide the CIDR
    Has its own default security group,network ACL, and route table
    Does not have internet gateway by default , one needs to be created if needed



------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to create a vpc

-> create a vpc
-> then subnet
-> then internet gateway
-> then route table



------------------------------------------------------------------


public subnet / private subnet


Public Subnet - If a subnet's traffic is routed to an internet gateway , the subnet is known as Public Subnet.If you want your instance
in a public subnet to communicate with the internet over ipv4, it must have a public IPv4 or an elastic ip address.


Private Subnet - If a subnet does not have a route to the internet  gateway, the subnet is known as a private subnet


--> When you create a vpc, you must specify an ipv4 CIDR block for the vpc.The allowed block size is between /16  to /28 netmask
--> The first four and last Ip address of subnet  cannot be assigned


for eg  10  0   0   0 / 16
        10  0   0   0    - > network address
        10  0   0   1    - > Reserved by AWS for the vpc router
        10  0   0   2    - > Reserved by AWS  The ip address of DNS server
        10  0   0   3    - > Reserved for future use
        10  0   0   255  - > Broadcast address

Note - Aws do not support broadcast in a vpc but reserve this address
