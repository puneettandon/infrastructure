Route53 Part -2

Route53 performs three main functions:-
1) Register a domain
2) As a DNS,it routes internet traffic to the resources for your domain
3) Check the health of your resources

- Route53 sends automated requests over the internet to a resource (can be a webserver) to verify that the server is reachable,
functional or available

- Also you can choose to receive

- You can use Route53 for any combination of these functions :

    for eg: You can use Route53 both to register your domain and to route internet traffic for the domain
    - or you can use Route53 to route internet traffic for a domain that you registered with another domain register


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> When you register a domain with Route53, the service automatically makes itself the DNS service for the domain by doing the following:

    - It created a hosted zone that has same name as your domain
    - It assigns a set of four name servers to the hosted zone, unique to the account
    - When someone uses a browser to access your website ,these name servers inform the browser where to find your resources,
    such as a web server or an  amazon s3 bucket.
    - It gets the name servers from the hosted zone and adds them to domain
