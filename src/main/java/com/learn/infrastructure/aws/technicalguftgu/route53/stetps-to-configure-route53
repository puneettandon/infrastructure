Steps to configure Route53

1) You need to register a domain, this can be Route53, or another DNS Register, but then you connect domain name in that registrar to Route53
2) Create Hosted zone on route53, this is done automatically if you registered your domain using Route53
 - Inside the hosted zone you need to create record sets


Delegate to Route53
- This steps connects everything and make it work
- Connect the domain name to Route53 hosted zone - This is called delegation

- Update your domain registrar with the correct name servers for your Route53 hosted zone
- No other customer hosted zone will share this delegation set with you
- Doing this means Route53 DNS Service will be serving DNS traffic for the domain of the hosted zone
- If you registered domain with a diff registrar , you need to configure the route53 DNS server list in your registrar DNS database for your domain

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are using another domain provider and you did all the changes -
- When you migrate from one DNS provider to another , for an existing domain this change can take upto 48 hours to be
effective.
- This is because name server dns records are typically cached across the DNS system globally on the internet for upto 48 hours(TTL) periods

Transferring a domain to Route53

- You can transfer a domain to Route53 if the TLD is included on the following list
- If the TLD is not included , you can't transfer the domain to Route53
- For most TLD, you need to get an authorization code from the current registrar to transfer a domain
