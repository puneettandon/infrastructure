Router


Also called Implied Router/Logical Router

-> It is the central routing function
-> It connects the different AZ together and connects the VPC to the internet gateway.
-> You can have upto 200 Route tables per vpc
-> You can have upto 50 route entries per route table
-> Each subnet must be associated with only one Route table at any given time
-> If you do not specify a subnet to route table association, the subnet will be associated with the default vpc route table
-> You can also edit the main route table if you need, but you cannot delete main route table
-> However you can make a custom route table manually.Become the main route table then you can delete the former main, as it is no longer a main route table
-> You can associate multiple subnets with the same route table



Internet Gateway

Connects Vpc with internet gateway
-> An internet gateway is a virtual router that connects a vpc to the internet
-> Default vpc is already attached with an internet gateway
-> If you create a new vpc then you must attach the internet gateway in order to access the internet
-> Ensure that your subnet's route table points to the internet gateway
-> It performs NAT between your private and public Ipv4 address
-> It support both ipv4 and ipv6

NAT Gateway
-> always present in public subnet
