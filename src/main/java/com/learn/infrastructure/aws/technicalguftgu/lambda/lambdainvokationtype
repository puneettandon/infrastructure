Lambda Function Invocation Type

1) Synchronous Invoke(Push)
2) Asynchronous Invoke (Event)
3) Poll-based invoke (Pull-based)


-----------------------------------

Synchronous invoke are most straight forward way to invoke your lambda function
In this model, your functions execute immediately when you perform the lambda invoke API call
- Invocation flag specifies a value of 'RequestResponse'
- You wait for the function to process the event and return a response

Here is a list of services that invoke lambda function synchronously
- Elastic load balancer
- Amazon cognito
- Cloudfront
- API Gateway
- Amazon Lex
- Kinesis Data Firehose


-----------------------------------

Asynchronous Invocation
- For Asynchronous invocation, lambda places the event in Queue and returns a success response without additional information
- Lambda queues the event for processing and returns a response immediately
- You can configure lambda to send an invocation record to another service like SQS,SNS,Lambda,Eventbridge

Here is a list of service that invoke lambda function asynchronously
- Amazon s3
- Amazon SNS
- Simple Email Service
- Cloud Formation
- Cloud Watch logs
- Cloud Watch Events
- AWS Code Commit
- AWS Config
- lambda to lambda
Does not wait for function2 to finish or response from function2


-------------------------------

Poll-Based Invokes
- This invocation model is designed to allow you to integrate with AWS stream and queue based service with no code
or server management.
- Lambda will poll the following service on your behalf, retrieve records and invoke your function

The following are supported services -
- Amazon kinesis
- Amazon SQS
- Amazon DynamoDB streams
