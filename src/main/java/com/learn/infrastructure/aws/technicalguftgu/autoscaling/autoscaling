Autoscaling

How Autoscaling works and what are the autoscaling components

Scalability
Fault Tolerance
High Availability



--------------------------------------------

-> Creating group of EC2 instances that can scale up or down  depending on conditions you set
-> Enable elasticity by scaling horizontally through adding or terminating EC2 instances
-> Autoscaling ensures that you have the right  number of AWS Ec2 instances for your needs at all time
-> Autoscaling helps you save cost by cutting down the number of EC2 instances when not needed, and
scaling out to add more instances only when it is required
