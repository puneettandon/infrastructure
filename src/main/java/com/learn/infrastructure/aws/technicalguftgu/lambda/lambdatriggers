Lambda Triggers

    - Events such as changes to data in Amazon s3 bucket or an amazon dynamodb table
    - To run your code in response to Http Request using Amazon API Gateway
    - With these capabilities, you can use lambda to easily build data processing triggers for aws services like amazon s3
    and amazon dynamodb , process streaming data stored in kinesis or create your own backend that operates at AWS scale performance and security



Example of S3

- The user create an object in a bucket
- Amazon s3 detects the object created event
- Amazon s3 invokes your lambda functions using the Permission provided by the execution role
- Amazon s3 knows which lambda function to invoke based on the event source mapping that is stored in the bucket
