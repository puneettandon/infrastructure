AWS Lambda

-> Aws Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
-> With aws lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration
-> Aws lambda manages all the administration it manages -
    - Provisioning and capacity of the  compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network and other resources.
    - Server and OS maintenance
    - High availability and automatic scaling
    - Monitoring fleet health
    - Applying security patches
    - Deploying your code
    - Monitoring and logging your lambda functions
    - Aws lambda runs your code on high availability compute infrastructure

-> Aws Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousand per second.
-> You pay only for the compute time you consume - no charge when your code is not running
-> All you need to do is supply your code in the form of one or more lambda functions to Aws lambda, in one of the languages
   (Currently it supports nodejs,java,python, C#,Ruby,Powershell and Go) and service can run code on your behalf.

Typically lifecycle for an AWS lambda based application includes authoring code, deploying code to aws lambda and then monitoring and troubleshooting

This is in exchange for flexibility , which means you cannot log into compute instances or customize operating system or language runtime

If you want to manage your own compute, you can use ec2 or elastic beanstalk.

How Lambda works?

-> First you upload your code to lambda in or more lambda function
-> AWS Lambda will then execute the code in your behalf
-> After the code is invoked, lambda automatically take care of provisioning and mapping the required servers

        AWS Lambda                                                       AWS Ec2

-> It is a platform as a service                                    It is an infrastructure as a service
-> It supports only limited languages                               No environment restrictions, you can run any code or language
like nodejs,java,python,go etc
-> Write your code and push your code into aws lambda               For the first time in ec2 , you have to choose the OS and install all
                                                                    the software required and then push your code into Ec2
-> You cannot log into compute instances , choose                   You can select variety of OS, instance type , network and security patches, RAM
customized OS or language platform                                  and CPU etc
-> Pay only for duration it run                                     Pay per second, minute, hourly
