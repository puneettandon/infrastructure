AWS Lambda Function Configuration

-> A lambda function consist of code and any associated dependencies
-> In addition, a lambda function also has configuration associated with it
-> Initially, you specify the configuration information when you create a lambda function
-> Lambda provides an API for you to update some of the configuration data


Lambda Function configuration information includes the following key elements:
-> Compute resource that you need
you only specify the amount of memory you want to allocate from your lambda function

-> Aws lambda allocates , CPU power proportional to the memory by using the same ratio as a general purpose amazon ec2 instance type
such as M3 type

-> You can update the configuration and request additional memory in 64 MB increments from 128MB to 3008 MB

-> Functions larger than 1536 MB are allocated multiple CPU threads

---------------------------------------------

Maximum Execution Timeout

-> you pay for the AWS resources that are used to run your lambda function
-> To prevent your lambda function from running indefinitely, you specify a timeout
-> When specified timeout is reached, AWS lambda terminates your function
-> Default is 3 seconds and max is 900 seconds(15 minutes)


-------------------------------------------------------

IAM Role

This is the role that AWS lambda assume when it executes the lambda on your behalf

-------------------------------------------------

AWS Lambda Function - Services it can access

Lambda functions can access -

- AWS services or Non-AWS services(services running on Ec2 instance)
- AWS services running in AWS VPC (eg -> redshift, RDS instance, ElasticCache)
- Non-AWS services running on Ec2 instances in AWS VPC
- AWS Lambda run your function code securely within a VPC by default
- However, to enable your lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC , you must provide additional
VPC - specific configuration information that includes VPC subnet id and security group IDs.
