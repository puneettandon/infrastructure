Autoscaling in AWS

-> If Autoscaling finds that the number of EC2 instances launched by AutoScalingGroup into subject AZs is not balanced.(EC2 instances are not
evenly distributed ) Autoscaling do re-balancing activity by itself.
-> As always tries to balance the instances distribution across the AZs
-> While re-balancing, Autoscaling group launches new EC2 instances where there are less EC2 at present, and then terminates EC2 from AZ,
that has more instances


What causes Imbalance of EC2
-> If we add or remove some subnets/AZ from AutoScalingGroup
-> If we manually request for EC2 termination from our ASG.
-> An AZ that did not enough EC2 capacity now has enough Capacity and it is one of our ASG.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-> We can attach a running EC2 instances to an Autoscaling Group by using AWS console or cli, if the below conditions are met-

    - Instances must be in running state (Not terminated or stopped)
    - AMI used to launch the EC2 still exist
    - Instance is not part of another ASG
    - Instance is in the same AZ of the same group
    EC2 and ASG  - same group

-> If the existing EC2 instances under the ASG,plus the one to be needed, exceed the max. capacity of the ASG,
the request will fail , EC2 instance would not be added


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> You can manually remove EC2 instances from an Autoscaling group using AWS console or cli
-> You can then manage the detached instances independently or attach it to another ASG
-> When you detach an instance, you have the option to decrement the ASG desired capacity
-> If you don't , the ASG will launch another instance to replace the one detached

-> When you delete an ASG,its parameters like maximum, minimum and desired capacity are all set to zero.Hence it terminates all its EC2 instances
-> If you want to keep the EC2 instances and manage them independently, you can manually detach them first , then delete the ASG
