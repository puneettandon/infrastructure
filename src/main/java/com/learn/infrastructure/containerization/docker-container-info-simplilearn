Docker and Container  - simplilearn



Why is Docker Container essential?

-> Consider an example where a company develops an oracle weblogic software
        A developer will setup an oracle weblogic software on his system
        After the application is developed, it is examined by testing team
               Here, the tester repeats the installation process of oracle weblogic
        Once the application is tested,it will deployed by the production team
                To host the java application,the system admin also must install oracle weblogic on his system


        Why is the same weblogic installation done thrice?
            Due to difference in computer environments, weblogic doesn't work on the other systems
            So installation is done separately on three different computers
            But this process consumes a lot of time and effort. Can there be alternative to this?

        Why not try Docker Containers?

What is Docker Container?

-> Containerization includes all the dependencies (framework,libraries etc) required to run an application in an efficient and bug-free manner.
-> With Docker Containers, applications can work efficiently in different computer environments
        Lightweight  --- Occupies less space   ---- Applications run in isolation
        Secure    --- Portable --- Short boot-up time


What is virtualization?

-> Virtualization refers to the method of running a virtual version of a computer resource(hardware,software,etc) on the cloud.
